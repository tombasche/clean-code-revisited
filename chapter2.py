# TODO - pull apart some of the examples in the book and how they can be improved through types
# When is it ok to use a,b,i,x etc.?
# noise words - this is still relevant. Take a few minutes to think of the intent of the data. data or information is always tempting - but everything is information! Maybe instead of UserInformation, UserDetails, UserBankAccounts etc.
# Names that you have to read out

# Rip apart the meaningful context example (side effects, stupid function names)
